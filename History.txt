== 0.1.1 2009-08-23

This release is just an update to comply with API changes in Cucumber 0.3.97

== 0.1.0 2009-08-17

This release is almost a complete rewrite of Cuke4Duke's internals. This is to take advantage
of Cucumber 0.3.96' new plugin API for language add-ons like Cuke4Duke. (The plan is to use the
same plugin API for a .NET equivalent of Cuke4Duke).

Check out the new Groovy DSL! It's almost identical to the native Ruby DSL.

This means that your existing Cuke4Duke project will probably break. If you're using Pure Java
Step Definitions, you no longer have to register them in support/env.rb. Instead you have to
use --require. Choosing between PicoContainer or Spring is done with the -Dcuke4duke.objectFactory
JVM argument.

=== New Features
* Automatically load StepDefinitions with --require (works with .java and .groovy) (Aslak Hellesøy)
* New Groovy DSL. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added support for After blocks (Juan Barreneche)

=== Removed features
* There are no more cuke4duke/*.rb files that you need to require in support/env.rb. You don't even need support/env.rb. (Aslak Hellesøy)

=== Changed Features
* The cuke4duke.spring.Steps annotation has been renamed to cuke4duke.spring.StepDefinitions

=== Bugfixes
* Java and Ruby step defs should be able to coexist (#4 Aslak Hellesøy)
* Downgraded JRuby from 1.4dev to 1.3.1 so people don't have to build their own JRuby (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Upgrade webtest example to jarib-celerity to 0.0.6.12 (Aslak Hellesøy)

== 0.0.7 2009-07-29

This release fixes compatibility issues with the latest Cucumber release, extends the Table API
and improves the Maven plugin in several areas.

=== New features
* Added new jvmArgs property to Maven plugin. See the Spring example for sample usage. (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Cucumber gem (and optional version) must be declared in POM. -Dcucumber.installGems no longer installs it by default.  (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Added several more methods to cuke4duke.Table, including the new diff methods.  (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Compatibility with cucumber 0.3.92  (Aslak Hellesøy)
* Ability to specify cucumber bin with -Dcucumber.bin= or <configuration><bin> in the Maven plugin (POM).  (Aslak Hellesøy)
